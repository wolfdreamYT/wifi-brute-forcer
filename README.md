# wifi-brute-forcer
this can brute force the wifi router login page (ROGERS WIFI ONLY)

THIS CODE IS NOT TO BE MESSED WITH

This code will actually brute force your very own wifi router, or the network your on, and cause stress on it.
i tested it on my own network, which was rogers ignite (the best) and the network went down completely in matter of moments,
and did not come back up until i stopped the code.

all you have to do is enter:

pip install requests

to run the code enter:

python3 main.py

Very very simple! please try this on your own wifi as it can cause severe damage and take down entire wifi network within minutes.
i coded this on my own time when i was sick, and i am very very proud to have been sick because this is a game changer for me!

You can control the wifi around you, and if someone pisses you off, you can just force them to use their own cell data by removing
wifi for everyone
